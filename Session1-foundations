## 🧭 Module: Foundations of UI/UX in FiveM

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
- Understand the difference between UI and UX
- Recognize the importance of clean interfaces in FiveM
- Apply the basics of visual hierarchy and grid systems to game UI
- Analyze examples of good vs. poor UI

## 🔍 1. Introduction to UI/UX

### 🧩 What is UI?
- **User Interface (UI)** refers to everything the user sees on the screen: buttons, text, icons, layouts.
- In FiveM: job menus, phone apps, inventories, shops.

### 🧠 What is UX?
- **User Experience (UX)** involves how the player feels when interacting with the UI — is it smooth, clear, and intuitive?

### 🎮 Game Context
- UI = how things look.
- UX = how things feel.
- Good UX = more immersion, fewer complaints.

## 🧠 2. Why UI/UX Matters in Game Servers

### 🚀 First Impressions Matter
- A clean UI shows professionalism.
- Increases player trust and retention.

### 🤯 Bad UI Leads to Confusion
- Example: menus with no labels, overlapping elements, small font.
- Can cause frustration and server dropouts.

### 🛠️ Analogy
> Using a bad UI is like using an ATM with no labels — just guessing what buttons to press.

---

## 🎯 3. Visual Hierarchy

### 📐 Definition:
The arrangement of elements to show their order of importance.

### 👁️ How Users Scan Screens
- **Z-pattern** (used for simpler UIs like websites)
- **F-pattern** (used in feeds or menus)

### 📊 Visual Tools to Create Hierarchy
- Size
- Color
- Contrast
- Placement
- Grouping

### 📝 Activity:
Identify the most important action in a sample menu. Is it clear?

---

## 🧱 4. Grid Systems

### 🔧 What is a Grid System?
- A framework of **columns, rows, gutters**, and **margins**.
- Keeps elements aligned and consistent.

### 📏 Why It Matters:
- Avoids “floating” or misaligned buttons.
- Helps with responsiveness and scaling.

### 💡 Common Standard:
- **12-column grid** – flexible, widely adopted in web/UI design.

## 💼 5. Practical Examples

| Case | Bad UI Example | Good UI Example |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Inventory Menu | Overcrowded, small icons, no grouping | Grouped sections, consistent spacing |
| ATM Screen | No labels, mismatched buttons | Clear labels, visual feedback on click |

---

## 📝 Homework Assignment

1. Choose a FiveM interface you use (e.g., job menu, tablet).
2. Write down:
   - What is **confusing**?
   - What is **clear**?
   - Suggest **one improvement**.
3. (Optional) Try sketching the layout using a 12-column grid.

## 🧭 Coming Up in Session 2
> **User Research & Personas**
> Learn how to gather feedback from players and turn insights into design decisions.

**Course Reminder:**  
You don’t need to be a designer to build great UI. With structure, logic, and empathy — anyone can create something clean and useful.
